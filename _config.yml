# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  I like to write down something interesting in my life for fun, and hope they
  can become a good memory in the future.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog

# The base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
#
# url can be used to build the link for the resources like image, and then used
# as input for 3rd party service, thus we need this to make resources accessable
# by the 3rd party service. Not sure if this can create any side effect though.
#
# Example for test purpose: "http://127.0.0.1:4000"
